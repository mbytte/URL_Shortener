# URL_Shortener

A basic cloud-structured project that accepts long URLs, shortens them, and returns the shortened URL to the original. This project is implemented using **Azure Functions** and demonstrates how serverless architectures can be used to build scalable, event-driven APIs.

## Disclaimer

Parts of the project plan and development flow were guided with the help of ChatGPT, including Azure tooling setup, function design, and architecture decisions. All implementation was done by me as part of my independent learning.

## Project Focus

This project is part of a learning exercise focused on:

- Understanding cloud-based serverless architecture
- Building and deploying Azure Function Apps
- Structuring API projects for cloud readiness
- Practicing cloud-native development with Python

## Tech Stack

- Azure Functions (Python)
- Azure CLI & Core Tools
- VS Code for development
- Postman or curl for testing API requests
